# Command-line VAMAS (.vms) to JSON converter

Convert hard-to-read VAMAS file to a bit less hard-to-read JSON file. Includes fancy output by default, grouping blocks by sample name (disabled by passing `--raw` as an argument).

For help, run `convert.py --help`.

Requires the `vamas` library (`pip install vamas`)
